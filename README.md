# World_Weather_Analysis

### Analysis

We take a look at different weather patterns around the world. We choose specific temperatures which our consumers prefer and based off that we provide them with travel and hotel information.
We provide three indepth analyisis which focus on the following:
1. Weather Database
2. Vacation Search
3. Vacation Itinerary 


Weather Database
We use the Open Weather Map API which brings information on over 700+ different cities around the world. 
We summarize the information into the following categories:
1. Cloudiness 
2. City
3. Country 
4. Humidity
5. Max Temp 
6. Windspeed

Difficulties:
This project was very overwhelming in comparison to others, I feel like I did not understand the material that well and found the open weather map API aspect very difficult.
